### Description
This Project gives you a Chrome Extension and a Progressive Web App (PWA) allowing you to control Youtube on your Desktop Browser from the PWA in your Mobile. It enforces a 1-1 connection between the Browser Extension and the PWA. The Extension gets connected to the PWA using a QR Code which has to be scanned using the built-in QR Code Scanner in the PWA. This will land you on the Infinity Remote page that allows you to control the Youtube. Proper Instructions / Icons helps the User control the Utility.

### Acknowledgement
This Project is created during June-July, 2021 under the event IITISoC'21, which is the Annual Dev Fest of IIT Indore to introduce the students to Software Development and Open Source. During IITISoC, the students work upon multiple Open Source Projects and they are mentored by experienced developers. The pattern followed by IITISoC is similar to GSoC so that the students get an idea of what GSoC is and how it works. We are grateful towards IIT Indore and IITISoC'21 for providing us this opportunity to build this amazing Project.
